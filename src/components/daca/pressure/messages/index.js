    <p>Dear Congressperson,</p>
    <p>
      My name is {name || '[INSERT YOUR NAME]'}, and I urge you to cosponsor, vote for, and pass S. 3609: Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act, a bill to ensure that all communities have access to urgently needed COVID-19 testing, treatment, public health information, and relief benefits regardless of immigration status or limited English proficiency, and for other purposes. This is a good first step towards protecting all human lives, regardless of immigration status, but more must be done. Immigrants constantly live in fear from US immigration enforcement agencies, preventing them from being able to access health facilities and other government necessities during an unprecedented pandemic.  We must dismantle ICE, CBP, and the other racist, anti-American immigration enforcement agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
    ICE is beyond reform-- it must be defunded and dismantled. The more than 30,000 immigrants forced into ICE detention centers are denied adequate food and medical care, subject to solitary confinement, and at greater risk for physical and sexual assault. In 2017, 12 people died in these centers. ICE wreaks havoc and fear among imigration population through their brutal raids in schools, courts, workplaces, and other community centers. I.C.E.’s brutal treatment of unauthorized immigrants and asylum-seekers flies in the face of the country’s foundation as a home for those fleeing persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
    The only groups ICE serves are white nationalists, advocates of ethnic cleansing, racists, and the for-profit prison industry. Geo and CoreCivic, two private, for-profit companies, detain the majority of ICE victims. The more people they force into detention, the more money they make. The Department of Homeland Security pays an estimated $159 per day for each person detained. Companies should not profit off of racism and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
    ICE’s concentration camps euphemised as “detention centers” can no longer exist. Do your part in dismantling America’s racist institutions. Start by cosponsoring, voting for, and passing S. 3609: Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act, and please advocate for dismantling ICE and CBP.

    <p> Thank you,</p>

    <p>Dear Congressperson,</p>
    <p>
      My name is {name || '[INSERT YOUR NAME]'}, and I urge you to cosponsor, vote for, and pass the BREATHE Act, which will end state and local police entanglement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and all federal immigration enforcement agencies, until ICE and CBP are fully dismantled. This is a good first step towards abolishing ICE, CBP, and the other racist, anti-American immigration enforcement agencies.

       <p>Dear Congressperson,</p>
    <p>
      My name is {name || '[INSERT YOUR NAME]'}, and I urge you to cosponsor, vote for, and pass S. 1440: PROTECT Immigration Act, which repeals the authority allowing the Department of Justice to enter into agreements authorizing state or local government employees to perform immigration enforcement functions. This is a good first step towards dismantling ICE, CBP, and the other racist, anti-American immigration enforcement agencies.
