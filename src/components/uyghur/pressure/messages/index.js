      Hello,

    { custom && <p>{custom}</p> }
    <p>
      I am contacting you to urge you to clarify your involvement in Uyghur forced labor in light of ASPI’s “Uyghurs for Sale” report, and to urge you to terminate all contracts with Xinjiang manufacturers benefitting from the forced labor of Uyghurs. It is imperative that we condemn the forced labor of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and the cultural genocide of Uyghur Muslims. The international market must hold China accountable for the oppression of Uyghur Muslims and ensure that forced labor-sourced goods do not enter our homes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The intentional genocide of Uyghurs in China is one of the worst crises that must be stopped, especially through international pressure. We need to do all we can to stop direct or indirect support of the detention and forced labor of Uyghurs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The freedom of access to and sale of forced labor-produced goods is unacceptable. It means that the United States partakes in the unspeakable violence caused by Xinjiang manufacturers benefiting from this torturous atrocity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Release a statement regarding your commitment to ethical manufacturing, and terminate all relationships with manufacturers benefiting from the forced labor of Uyghur Muslims. Until then, you have lost a customer. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Thank you,
