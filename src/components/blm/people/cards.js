            DeRay Mckesson was an early member of the Black Lives Matter Movement who was involved in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland marches and social networking sites including Twitter and Instagram. Along with Johnetta Elzie, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe, Mckesson introduced Campaign Zero, an advocacy forum to stop excessive brutality. A ten-point action agenda to strengthen policing. Main issues include the decriminalization of trespassing, distribution of drugs, loitering, public nuisance, and drinking of beverages in public as such offenses do not endanger public protection but are used to intimidate African Americans. In July 2017, Baton Rouge police charged Mckesson and Black Lives Matter, who suffered life-altering injury in an arson assault, alleging that Black Lives Matter “incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death of black men shot by police”.
