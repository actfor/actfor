        <h1>US-Backed Saudi Coalition is Responsible for the World’s Worst Crisis</h1>

        <p>
        The man-made crisis in Yemen is the world’s worst catastrophe. Over <b>24 million people</b> in Yemen desperately need aid, of which <b>12.2 million</b> are children. <b>3.2 million people</b> have “acute malnutrition,” including <b>two million children</b> under five and <b>one million pregnant and lactating women</b>. <b>17.8 million</b> people lack water and sanitation, resulting in the world's fastest cholera epidemic. <b>14.8 million</b> people lack access to healthcare. <b>10 million</b> people are expected to starve by the end of the year. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The crisis in Yemen did not just happen; it has been <i>directly and primarily</i> caused by air strikes and a naval blockade from Saudi Arabia, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and eight other Sunni nations in a Saudi-formed coalition. This piece will discuss the origins of the crisis, the destructive involvement of the U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia coalition, and the tragic effects of the Yemeni Civil War on an already vulnerable population. Lastly, the piece will outline what you can do-- through political action, public pressure, and humanitarian aid-- to help alleviate the dire effects of the world’s worst crisis.

        <h3>Origins of the Crisis: The Yemeni Civil War</h3>

        <p>
          Conflict in Yemen originates from the Arab Spring Revolution in 2011 and a subsequent failure to establish peace due to the corrupt transition from authoritarian leader Ali Abdullah Saleh to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Masour Hadi. The UN and other peace organizations attempted to facilitate a National Dialogue Conference to establish a democracy as Saleh handed power to Hadi, but general distrust of Hadi as a beneficiary of Saleh’s corruption resulted in its failure.  In 2015, conflict developed into a civil war between the former Hadi Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, champions of the Zaidi Shia Muslim minority in the country. Both the Hadi administration and the Houthis claim to be the official government of Yemen. The human rights violations of the Houthis, especially their use of child soldiers and diversion of critical aid, overstepped the initial goals of the Arab Spring. In the midst of the corruption of the Hadi government and its inability to address unemployment and food insecurity, Ali Abdulleh Saleh’s support of the Houthi movement further marred what should have been an Arab Spring Revolution. Yemenis thought that the involvement of Saleh marked an attempt to regain control of the country, the complete opposite of what was fought for in the Arab Spring four years before. Opposition of both the Hadi government and the Houthis for their perpetuation of the war and destruction of the Arab Spring is prevalent among the Yemeni population.

        <p>
          In January of 2015, Houthi rebels kidnapped Hadi’s Chief of Staff Ahmed bin Mubarak and invaded the presidential palace, forcing President Hadi to resign shortly after. After initial phases of airstrikes and bombings from ISIS, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of the United States, United Kingdom, France, and eight Sunni Arab states, the United Nations (UN) attempted to facilitate peace talks between the warring parties in Kuwait from April to August in 2016. However, Houthi rebels rejected the peace proposal. They then formed a new government in Yemen’s capital led by Abdul Aziz Habtoor. Although Saleh supported the Houthi movement, he was killed by Houthi rebels in December 2017. As of 2020, the Houthi rebels control western Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, while Hadi loyalists maintain control of about two thirds of the country. To make the situation worse, ISIS and AQAP use the chaos for their own agenda - committing violent attacks and seizing territory in Yemen.

        <h3>Saudi Arabia and US Involvement</h3>

        <p>
          Despite the claims of the Saudi government, the proxy conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia does not fully manifest in the Yemeni civil war. While Iran provides logistical and technological support to the Houthis, Iran does not control Houthi efforts in the same way the Saudi coalition exerts complete influence on the Hadi government. Saudi Arabia already has a long history in Yemen and used Iran’s backing as a justification to interfere in the Yemeni Civil War. In fact, a 2009 Wikileaks Memo revealed that the “Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG [Republic of Yemen government] military itself ‘by buying them from corrupt commanders and soldiers... the military covers up its failures by saying the weapons come from Iran” <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302064592_Iran%27s_policy_towards_the_Houthis_in_Yemen_A_limited_return_on_a_modest_investment?fbclid=IwAR0Do1Hye6Ymtx1uvEr-Xnc5rlH0JY88uqQiNePX8vD_jINJt2tzObm_Vuk" target="_blank">(Juneau 2016)</a>. In 2015, Hadi sought support from Saudi Arabia and encouraged their intervention. Even though Iran’s support of the Houthis is limited, Saudi Arabia retaliated in a disproportionate manner by forming a coalition to restore the Hadi government, killing hundreds of thousands of Yemenis in an airstrike campaign. <b>Ultimately, Iran’s limited support of the Houthi rebels does not justify the Saudi coalition’s violence in Yemen. </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Now based in Saudi Arabia, Hadi has been ineffective in providing basic humanitarian services to the people of Yemen. In 2017, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition imposed a naval blockade on Yemen to prevent weapons from being smuggled to the Houthi rebels. However, the restrictions resulted in heavy taxes on food, healthcare supplies, and fuel for Yemenis. This blockade is the primary contributor to the severe crisis Yemen is experiencing today. The coalition also launched a major offensive on the Red Sea City of Hudayah in 2018, which contains a port that two-thirds of the Yemeni population depend on for importing basic needs. The UN warned that the destruction of the port would cause millions of more to die because of famine. After six months of fighting and then ceasefire negotiations in Sweden, the forces agreed to withdraw from Hudayah, but the full withdrawal has not taken place. There are valid fears that the agreement will collapse and fighting will resume.

          Throughout these events, the United States has supported Saudi-led coalition attacks in an effort to deter the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. In fact, the United States sends more weapons to Saudi Arabia than any other nation -- allowing its and Saudi Arabia’s rivalry with Iran to dictate their policy choices. In late 2017, the U.S. secretly sent a team of elite forces, the Green Berets, to help the Saudi coalition defeat the Houthi rebels (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/green-berets-helping-saudi-arabia-yemen-destroy-houthi-missiles-2018-5" targe="_blank">Brown</a>, 2018). Lockheed Martin, a company based in the United States, sold the very bomb Saudi Arabia coalition deployed, killing 40 Yemeni boys in 2018 (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/10/world/meast/yemen-fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Editorial Research</a>, 2020). In 2019, CNN revealed that the coalition sent U.S.-manufactured weapons to AQAP (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/10/world/meast/yemen-fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Editorial Research</a>, 2020). The Trump administration has increased U.S. aid to the Saudi coalition with little public attention or debate: President Trump approved a deal in May 2019 to sell eight billion dollars worth of U.S. weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/questions-raised-110bn-arms-deal-saudi-arabia-170608033511760.html" target="_blank">Roberts</a>, 2019). <b>Yemen is not just a humanitarian issue; it is a result of Western imperialist violence and domination, crippling the country and killing millions of civilians.</b>

        <h3>Full Effects of the War: The World’s Worst Crisis </h3>

        <p>
          80 percent of the country needs humanitarian aid to survive, 60 percent do not have enough to eat day by day, 58 percent do not have access to clean water, 52 percent of the country has little or no access to health care, and 11 percent of the country is severely malnourished. Political conflict in Yemen prevented access to basic needs and services, destroyed the economy, and severely diminished healthcare access for the entire population.
