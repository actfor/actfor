      The man-made crisis in Yemen is the world’s worst catastrophe. <b>Over 24 million people</b> in Yemen desperately need aid, of which <b>12.2 million</b> are children. <b>3.2 million</b> people have “acute malnutrition”, including <b>two million children</b> under five and <b>one million pregnant and lactating women. 17.8 million people</b> lack water and sanitation, resulting in the world's fastest cholera epidemic. <b>14.8 million people</b> lack access to healthcare. <b>10 million people</b> are expected to starve by the end of the year.

      The crisis in Yemen did not just happen; it has been directly and primarily caused by air strikes and a naval blockade from Saudi Arabia, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and eight other Sunni nations in a Saudi-formed coalition. This piece will discuss the origins of the crisis, the destructive involvement of the U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia coalition, and the tragic effects of the Yemeni Civil War on an already vulnerable population. Lastly, the piece will outline what you can do-- through political action, public pressure, and humanitarian aid-- to help alleviate the dire effects of the world’s worst crisis.

      The United States sends more weapons to Saudi Arabia than any other nation. This is unacceptable. Do the right thing. <b>Please save lives by ending US support for Saudi intervention in Yemen.</b>
